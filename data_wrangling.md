## Key Points
* To change a data table by adding a new column, or changing an existing one, we use the mutate() function.
* To filter the data by subsetting rows, we use the function filter().
* To subset the data by selecting specific columns, we use the select() function.
* We can perform a series of operations by sending the results of one function to another function using the pipe operator, %>%.

* When working on advanced analysis, manipulating tables is an important skill. 

*Based on question 8 3.2 Basic Data Wrangling*
**When piping, Note that select no longer has a data frame as the first argument. The first argument is assumed to be the result of the operation conducted right before the %>%**
